    "content": "Well, yes, on both fronts, so let us explain a little.\nFirst, we have the luxury of having achieved real product-market fit:  we are\nmaking\na product\nthat people want to buy.  This takes\non additional dimensions when making something physical: with complexities like\nmanufacturing, inventory, cash-conversion, and shifting supply chains,\nproduct-market fit implies getting the unit economics of the business right.\nAll of this is a long way of saying: we did not (and do not) need to raise\ncapital to support the business.\nSo if we didn’t need to raise, why seek the capital?  Well, we weren’t seeking\nit, really.  But our\ninvestors, seeing the business take off, were eager to support it.  And we, in\nturn, were eager to have them:  they were the ones, after all, who joined us in\ntaking a real leap when it felt like there was a lot more risk on the table.\nThey understood our vision for the company and shared our love for customers\nand our desire to build a singular team.  They had been with us in some\ndifficult moments; they know and trust us, as do we them.  So being able to raise\na Series C purely from our existing investors presented a real opportunity.\nStill, even from investors that we trust and with a quick close, if the business\ndoesn’t need the money, does it make sense to raise?  We have always believed\nthat our biggest challenge at Oxide was time — and therefore capital.  We\nspelled this out in our initial pitch deck from 2019:\nChallenges slide from Oxide original pitch deck ca. 2019\nSix years later, we stand by this, which is not to minimize any of those\nchallenges: the technical challenges were indeed hard; we feel fortunate to have\nattracted an extraordinary team; and we certainly caught some\nlucky breaks\nwith respect to the market.  With this large Series C, we have entirely\nde-risked capital going forward, which in turn assures our independence.\nThis last bit is really important, because any buyer of infrastructure has\nhad their heart broken countless times by promising startups that succumbed to\nacquisition by one of the established players that they were seeking to\ndisrupt.  The serial disappointments leave a refreshing bluntness in their\nwake, and it’s not uncommon for us to be asked directly: \"How do I know you\nwon’t be bought?\"\nOur intent in starting Oxide was not to be an\nacquisition target but rather build a generational company; this is our life’s\nwork, not a means to an end.  With our Series C, customers\ndon’t have to merely take our word for it:  we have the capital to assure our\nsurvival into the indefinite future.  If our Series B left us with confidence\nin achieving\nour mission\n, our\nSeries C leaves us with certainty: we’re going to kick butt, have fun, not\ncheat (of course!), love our customers — and\nchange computing forever\n.",

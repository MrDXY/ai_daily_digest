    "content": "Rad-Therapy II\nThe original port of\nHalf-Life 2\n(2004) to Quake(World).\nThe game is\nnot\nplayable from start to finish.\nYou can play deathmatch and other odd modes.\nRequires both\nhl2\nand\nhl2dm\ndirectories in order to function. Any copy will do fine. If you're on a case-insensitive filesystem and you're running pre .vpk data files you might want to put them in a .zip and name it 'pak0.pk3'. It's generally easier to just use the latest data from Steam.\nPlaying/Installing\nRun\nFTE\nlike so:\nfteqw.exe -halflife2\nIt will then automatically attempt to install\nRad-Therapy II\n- when run from within your\nHalf-Life 2: Deathmatch\ndirectory.\nBuilding\nGit clone\nNuclide\nfirst, run\nmake update\nand\nmake fteqcc\n, then clone the repository inside the Nuclide-SDK:\ngit clone https://code.idtech.space/fn/hl2 hl2\nmake game GAME=hl2\nmake plugins GAME=hl2\nThe last command will build the plugins required for the engine to load the data files. The one before it will build the game-logic.\nMake sure that Nuclide-SDK has\nfteqcc\nand\nfteqw\npresent for building and running, respectively.\nIt will also respect versions installed by the package manager, just make sure it's up to date.\nMatrix\nIf you're a fellow Matrix user, join the Nuclide Space. Where you can ask questions, or prod devs about what they're up to.\nhttps://matrix.to/#/#nuclide:matrix.org\nIRC\nYou can also join us on #nuclide via irc.libera.chat.\nIt's bridged with the main room of the Matrix space.\nLicense\nISC License\nCopyright (c) 2019-2025 Marco \"eukara\" Cawthorne\nmarco@icculus.org\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\ncopyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\nWITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

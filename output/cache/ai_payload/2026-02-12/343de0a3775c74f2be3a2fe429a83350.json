    "content": "Today the Go team is pleased to release Go 1.26.\nYou can find its binary archives and installers on the\ndownload page\n.\nLanguage changes\n¶\nGo 1.26 introduces two significant refinements to the language\nsyntax and type system\n.\nFirst, the built-in\nnew\nfunction, which creates a new variable, now allows its operand to be an\nexpression, specifying the initial value of the variable.\nA simple example of this change means that code such as this:\nx := int64(300)\nptr := &x\nCan be simplified to:\nptr := new(int64(300))\nSecond, generic types may now refer to themselves in their own type parameter list. This change\nsimplifies the implementation of complex data structures and interfaces.\nPerformance improvements\n¶\nThe previously experimental\nGreen Tea garbage collector\nis now enabled by default.\nThe baseline\ncgo overhead has been reduced\nby approximately 30%.\nThe compiler can now\nallocate the backing store\nfor\nslices on the stack in more situations, which improves performance.\nThe\ngo fix\ncommand has been completely rewritten to use the\nGo analysis framework\n, and now includes a\ncouple dozen “\nmodernizers\n”, analyzers\nthat suggest safe fixes to help your code take advantage of newer features of the language\nand standard library. It also includes the\ninline\nanalyzer\n, which\nattempts to inline all calls to each function annotated with a\n//go:fix inline\ndirective.\nTwo upcoming blog posts will address these features in more detail.\nMore improvements and changes\n¶\nGo 1.26 introduces many improvements over Go 1.25 across\nits\ntools\n, the\nruntime\n,\ncompiler\n,\nlinker\n,\nand the\nstandard library\n.\nThis includes the addition of three new packages:\ncrypto/hpke\n,\ncrypto/mlkem/mlkemtest\n, and\ntesting/cryptotest\n.\nThere are\nport-specific\nchanges\nand\nGODEBUG\nsettings\nupdates.\nSome of the additions in Go 1.26 are in an experimental stage\nand become exposed only when you explicitly opt in. Notably:\nThese experiments are all expected to be generally available in a\nfuture version of Go. We encourage you to try them out ahead of time.\nWe really value your feedback!\nPlease refer to the\nGo 1.26 Release Notes\nfor the complete list\nof additions, changes, and improvements in Go 1.26.\nOver the next few weeks, follow-up blog posts will cover some of the topics\nrelevant to Go 1.26 in more detail. Check back later to read those posts.\nThanks to everyone who contributed to this release by writing code, filing bugs,\ntrying out experimental additions, sharing feedback, and testing the release candidates.\nYour efforts helped make Go 1.26 as stable as possible.\nAs always, if you notice any problems, please\nfile an issue\n.\nWe hope you enjoy using the new release!",

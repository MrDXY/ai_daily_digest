    "summary": "GitHub Agentic Workflows（gh-aw）允许开发者用自然语言的 Markdown 编写“代理式工作流”，并在 GitHub Actions 中运行，让 AI 代替人执行仓库内的自动化任务。项目强调从设计层面内置多重安全防护（默认只读、受控写入、沙箱与网络隔离等），并提供文档、示例与配套组件以便落地使用。整体定位是把“AI 代理能力”以可审计、可治理的方式产品化到 CI/CD 与仓库运维流程中。",
    "core_value": "将 AI 代理的任务编排与执行引入 GitHub Actions，使仓库维护、自动化操作可以用自然语言快速定义并运行。通过默认最小权限与多层 Guardrails，降低 AI 自动化在代码与供应链层面的安全风险。",

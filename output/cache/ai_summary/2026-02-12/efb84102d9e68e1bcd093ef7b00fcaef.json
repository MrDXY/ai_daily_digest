      "title": "Why vampires live forever",
      "content": "Feb 9, 2026\n· 14 min read\nWhy Vampires Live Forever\nI recently wrote about\nwhat the longevity experts don’t tell you\n. Since then, I’ve been thinking about why so many of the people in this space are obsessed with blood transfusions specifically. It seemed like a strange fixation — until I looked at the evidence properly.\nI think they’re vampires. Not metaphorically. I think the modern longevity movement is a vampire disclosure program.\nLet me explain.\nThe Science\nIn 1864, a French physiologist named Paul Bert surgically connected two mice so they shared a circulatory system.\n1\nWhen he connected an old mouse to a young one, the old mouse got younger. The technique is called parabiosis, from the Greek\npara\n(next to) and\nbios\n(life), which is also how vampires have historically described feeding.\nBy the 1950s, researchers at Cornell had extended this work and found that old rats connected to young rats lived four to five months longer than controls.\n2\nThe scientific community filed this under “interesting but impractical” and moved on.\nThen in 2005, Stanford researchers revived the technique and showed that within five weeks, old mice connected to young mice had muscle and liver tissue that resembled young tissue.\n3\nThis made international headlines. The framing was: “Scientists discover young blood reverses aging.”\nThe vampires, presumably, were not surprised.\nThe Suspects\nPeter Thiel\nConsider the facts:\nPale. Gaunt. Appears to not age but also to never have been young.\n4\nTold\nInc.\nmagazine that he finds parabiosis “really interesting” and that his interest is personal rather than commercial.\n5\nHis company’s chief medical officer subsequently contacted Ambrosia, a startup that charged $8,000 to inject you with young people’s blood plasma.\n6\nThe company was called\nAmbrosia\n— the food of the gods. Subtle.\nHas taken human growth hormones and investigated extreme calorie restriction.\n7\nGawker reported he was spending $40,000 per quarter on blood infusions from an 18-year-old, though this was never confirmed.\n8\nCo-founded Palantir, a company whose name comes from the all-seeing stones in Lord of the Rings.\n9\nPalantír literally means “far-seeing.” You know what else is far-seeing? A creature that has been alive for centuries.\nDestroyed Gawker, the media outlet that reported on his blood habits. He secretly funded a $10 million lawsuit that resulted in a $140 million judgement, bankrupting the company.\n10\nWhen a journalist gets too close to revealing a vampire, the vampire destroys the journalist’s entire organization. This is standard vampire operational security. It has been standard since at least the 1600s.\nBought a 477-acre estate on the shores of Lake Wanaka in New Zealand’s South Island.\n11\nRemote. Southern hemisphere. Minimal sunlight scrutiny. He has called New Zealand his “utopia.”\n12\nThiel told\nBusiness Insider\nin 2012 that death is “a problem that can be solved.”\n13\nThis is not the language of a man who fears death. This is the language of a man who solved it in the 1400s and is tired of pretending.\nBryan Johnson\nJohnson is more complicated, because he appears to be conducting his vampirism in public. This is either a strategic error or an unprecedented act of courage.\nHe transfused his 17-year-old son’s blood plasma into his own body. His son, Talmage, also received Johnson’s plasma in return. Johnson framed this as “multi-generational plasma exchange.”\n14\nVampires have historically called this “turning.”\nHe discontinued the blood exchange after data showed “no benefits.”\n15\nA suspicious person might note that a vampire would say exactly this after the media got too interested.\nHis skin has the grey, translucent quality of someone who has optimised past the point of appearing human. He is 48 but looks like a very well-preserved 300.\nHe publicly tracks his erections, sleep, body fat, and organ age with the zeal of someone documenting a body he has not yet fully figured out how to operate.\n16\nHis company is called Blueprint. As in: he is sharing the blueprint.\nThe Historical Record\nThe longevity community presents parabiosis research as a modern scientific breakthrough. This is wrong. Blood-based life extension has been documented for millennia:\nRoman spectators rushed into arenas to drink the blood of fallen gladiators, believing it transferred vitality.\n17\nThe scientific community calls this “anecdotal.” Vampires call it “dining out.”\nIn 1489, the Italian philosopher and Catholic priest Marsilio Ficino published\nDe Vita Libri Tres\n, in which he explicitly recommended that the elderly suck the blood of a youth from a vein in the left arm. His exact words: “Why shouldn’t our old people, namely those who have no other recourse, likewise suck the blood of a youth?”\n18\nHe published this. Openly. In a book. As a priest.\nElizabeth Báthory, a 16th-century Hungarian noblewoman, allegedly tortured and murdered hundreds of young women. Legends that she bathed in their blood to retain her youth first appeared in print over a century after her death and are likely embellished, but she was nonetheless confined — possibly walled up — in a room in her own castle until she died.\n19\nWhich is exactly what you’d expect humans to do to a vampire they couldn’t kill.\nBram Stoker published\nDracula\nin 1897. The novel features a centuries-old aristocrat who sustains himself on young blood, sleeps in unusual conditions, has extraordinary physical abilities for his apparent age, and is eventually destroyed by a group of people who figure out what he is. Stoker, a theatre manager with no medical background, somehow described the basic mechanism of heterochronic parabiosis almost perfectly — ninety years before Stanford “discovered” it.\nThe standard explanation is that Stoker drew on Eastern European folklore. The alternative explanation is that Stoker drew on Eastern European vampires.\nThe Twist\nHere’s what’s genuinely interesting. Recent research from UC Berkeley suggests that the benefit of young blood might not come from something\nin\nthe young blood. It might come from\ndiluting\nthe old blood.\n20\nThe young blood doesn’t add youth. It removes age.\nIf true, this reframes the entire vampire mythology. Vampires don’t drink blood because young blood contains an elixir. They drink blood because their own blood accumulates factors that accelerate aging, and they need to periodically dilute it. Feeding isn’t nutrition. It’s dialysis.\nThis also explains why vampires need to feed\nregularly\n. The effect is temporary. The old blood factors rebuild. This is consistent with the Stanford mouse data, where the rejuvenating effects diminished after the mice were separated.\n21\nThe Disclosure Timeline\nI believe we are watching a carefully managed disclosure:\nPhase 1 (1864–2000):\nScientific groundwork. Establish parabiosis as a legitimate research technique. Build the academic cover story.\n22\nPhase 2 (2005–2015):\n“Breakthrough” papers from Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley. Seed the idea that blood-based rejuvenation is\nscientifically plausible\nrather than supernatural.\n23\nPhase 3 (2016–2023):\nEarly adopters go public. Thiel funds blood startups. Johnson transfuses his son on camera. The public begins to associate blood transfusion with eccentric billionaires rather than with undead predators. This is a critical narrative shift.\nPhase 4 (2024–present):\nNormalisation. Podcasts. Netflix documentaries.\n24\nThe word “parabiosis” enters mainstream vocabulary. By the time full disclosure happens, the public will have been primed to see vampirism as a “wellness protocol” rather than a curse.\nWhat Dracula Got Wrong\nThe one thing the longevity-vampire community has not yet learned from Dracula is operational security.\nDracula operated in silence for centuries. He didn’t have a podcast. He didn’t track his erection quality on a public dashboard. He didn’t appear on Netflix. He understood that the fundamental rule of being a vampire is:\ndon’t talk about being a vampire.\nJohnson, Thiel, and their cohort have broken this rule comprehensively. Whether this represents a new era of transparency or a catastrophic strategic miscalculation remains to be seen.\nIn the meantime, I will be monitoring their blood work with interest.",

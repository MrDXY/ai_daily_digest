      "content": "I Wrote a Scheme in 2025\nby Matthew Plant\nOne year minus one week ago to the day I\npublished an article\nannouncing the new Scheme implementation I was writing,\nscheme-rs\n.\nToday I am excited to announce that\nscheme-rs\nhas reached its first version,\n0.1.0\n. You can check it out at it’s website (\nscheme-rs.org\n, which should be\nupdated to\nscheme.rs\nat some point when DNS propagation finishes) or its\ngithub page\n.\nAlthough there’s much more work to do (and I will talk about that further down\nthe page), after reaching the milestone of completing\n2258\ntests in the R6RS\ntest suite, I’ve decided that\nscheme-rs\nis stable enough to commit to a first\nrelease.\nIt’s been a pretty amazing journey, one that I’m excited to continue on.\nChanges since I initially announced scheme-rs last year:\nThere have been some changes since I initially announced scheme-rs. The biggest\nis that it is no longer exclusively async, and now supports sync as well.\nThis change was inevitable; only supporting async would really hamper adoption\n(or more importantly my personal use cases for the project). But I’m really\nhappy that I was able to implement this change without hamstringing async\nsupport at all. In fact, it is even possible to use scheme-rs in both async and\nsync contexts.\nThings that are not finished\nThere are quite a few things that are not quite complete, and I will list them\nhere:\nThe garbage collector has quite a bit of room for improvement.\nPerformance in general is Ok but could be made much better.\nThere are a lot of missing procedures and syntax from R6RS but also just in\ngeneral, for example I’d really like to add pattern matching.\nThere’s always more documentation that can be added.\nDebugging could be greatly improved.\nBut more importantly, I’m very excited to start working on the new language I am\nbuilding on top of\nscheme-rs\n. I mentioned that it would be strongly typed, but\nnow I think I might want to use calculus of construction. The possibilities are\ntruly endless!\nAn aside on how scheme-rs came to be:\nIn August of last year I had just lost my job. I wasn’t sure exactly what to do.\nI looked out on the landscape of software engineering jobs and became\nincreasingly uncertain of my place in it. I had been unsatisfied with work for a\nnumber of years at that point, and it felt like I had lost the differentiating\nfactor that made me worth hiring in the first place. The idea of getting a job\nthat was interesting, one that challenged me, seemed to be completely out of\nreach.\nI decided that what I would do is look inward. I would try to rediscover where\nmy original love for computer science came from. I had this dinky little project\nthat I had been working on and off on for a while with no clear vision. I\ndecided that I would spend my free time dedicated to that project. I would do\nresearch and focus on doing things correctly and with a strong backing from\nacademics. I’d apply for a few jobs, but if those fell through I’d apply for\ngrad school instead.\nI’d buy a printer and read papers.\nThat dinky little project was\nscheme-rs\n, and it’s hard to describe just how\nmuch it changed my life. I feel much more confident in my ability as a software\nengineer. I no longer think that a PhD is something that is meant for people\nmuch smarter than me. And more miraculously it directly lead me to finding a job\nthat I absolutely love.\nscheme-rs\nis not particularly special in this regard. It was simply something\nthat challenged me. And if you have a brain at all like mine, I highly\nrecommend you find a project that challenges you like\nscheme-rs\nchallenged me.\nIf you like being challenged and enjoy functional programming and Rust as much\nas I do, check out\nthe careers page at OneChronos!",
